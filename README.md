author: DEV-RUDY
other contributors: none /Dev rudy coded the whole website alone
general languages: html=80% css=60% js=40%
disadvantages: i have quit using js frameworks because it is frustrating to learn  another strand of knowledge base  everytime a framwork or library  updates  or upgrades I an probably in the middle of learning vue js  at that time  and eventually  they  ended  the support on vue 2 which is  so  frustrating  and i found that i dont want to waste time  with those  libraries anymore .
advantages: since it is all static, it is much easier to manipulate and much easier to load 
product origin:lazada
image  origins:lazada  and google using image  address so that rendering is much faster  and less memory resources is used
